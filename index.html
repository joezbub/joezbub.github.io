                                        With 37 pages, this book is short and sweet, I learned about some technologies that I had never heard of (esp. Avenza Maps)! I will be sure to try them out once shelter in place ends... and I agree that iNaturalist is amazing!!! Very thoughtful of the author to showcase free technologies, and I agree about making the outdoors accessible by all. Also, it is pretty cool that he got into long distance hiking due to Boy Scouts. My son is involved as well! Not a 5 star because I feel trailpost should get more love. The author only spent half a page on it! It is a better choice than LighterPack IMO since it looks nicer on a phone and I use one all the time. Unlike what the book says, mobile friendly gear lists are not just for "showing off gear lists on the trail" LOL). Good humor though! For a free book, this is a really insightful read, honestly surprised not a lot of people mention this book.

                                        <h3><b>Andrew Miller on Google Play</b></h3>
                                        Informative read. Ive been a day-hiker or a "weekend warrior" for a long time now so Ive never needed to use GPS tracking or CalTopo too much. But COVID has me really yearning to be out there... I guess I will take longer trips after shelter-in-place is over and try out GeoPDFs on Avenza Maps. The battery tips are helpful, changed the settings for a few things. The alternatives he introduces are nice, always wanted a mobile LighterPack interface. Definitely recommend.

                                        <h3><b>Anonymous on Google Books</b></h3>
                                        It's not often that I find such an easy read about backpacking that is definitely relevant today. This is essentially a guide to a bunch of apps, many of which I've heard of but never got to use. Lighterpack sounds like an amazing website, and I just made an account. I never realized that my cook set was that heavy! Anyways, the book provides a bunch of information in a concise, easy-to-read manner. The settings to preserve battery life were really useful too.

                                A few other engineering and medicine oriented students and I spent a few months working on an app that could track the rapid spread of COVID-19. While many governments, such as China and South Korea, have implemented functional contact tracing apps, they are notorious for their lack of privacy. Traditional solutions like decentralization or using Bluetooth are simply too complex or inadequate. Our solution mainly revolves around 
                                the user sending the hash of coordinates and a semi-trusted database that will do the matching and identifying of at-risk users. Infected users can report their diagnoses, which are verified and updated on the database and heat map. Read the manuscript below for the details.

                                In this project, I designed my multi-provider cloud architecture based on the criteria of ensuring confidentiality, availability, and integrity of attorney documents. I further emphasized providing efficiency and usability to encourage future testing of my architecture in law firms. 
                                My experimental results indicate the low computational overhead of adding the secret-sharing approach to a multi-cloud environment, even on consumer grade hardware. This will be essential for integrating law firms as active participants into our architecture. The only possible way of compromising this system is if multiple cloud providers collude, which is still unlikely given that the shares are additionally encrypted.

                                Hi, I am a high schooler at Lynbrook High School in San Jose, California! I created my website mainly to document my backpacking trips. As an ultralight backpacker, I spend countless hours researching gear options and cool trails around me. If you take a look at my gear (linked above), it is clear that I take many sacrifices in comfort to streamline my pack weight. For instance, 
                                I do not bring a stove, but rather, I cold soak, using cold water to rehydrate my oats, couscous, and other calorie dense foods. I also ditched my tent for a flat tarp, so my trekking poles could serve multiple purposes. So far, I have section-hiked part of the JMT (with my boys Alden and Jeremy) and most of the more minor backpacking trails around me.  
                                As an Eagle Scout, I take full advantage of our many outings to test out new gear, like my new tarp! My dream is to hike the PCT after graduation. However, I started to record some of my cybersecurity projects on my website to document my avid exploration of this exciting field. After an apprenticeship at the Department of Defense, I became intrigued by network security and the detection of APT attacks. From there, I branched off to applied cryptography and the 
                                security of cloud computing (see my secret sharing and contact tracing projects). Recently, I have become inreasingly fascinated about memory forensics and malware detection under the guidance of Prof. Brendan of the <a href="https://cyfi.ece.gatech.edu" target="_blank">CyFI Lab at Georgia Tech</a>. Feel free to check out my work on GitHub.
