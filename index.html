                                    <p>As we progress through the Digital Age, technologyâ€™s rapid adoption brings unparalleled convenience to all aspects of life. Humans have access to an abundance of information, making education accessible by virtually anyone. Exploring activities and hobbies that were once obscure is now easier than ever as more and more people are joining and learning from online backpacking communities. Smartphones are now ubiquitous because these light, powerful devices possess high quality cameras, location tracking capabilities, and ample memories for numerous documents and pictures. Their ample battery lives make them perfect assistance on the trail. As there is a growing market for outdoor applications, I present about technologies I use to facilitate my trips. For each software recommended, I provide an introduction and a fundamental guide to get started. I made sure that all the technologies in this book are free, promoting the principle that just like technology, the outdoors should be accessible by all.

                                In this project, I designed my multi-provider cloud architecture based on the criteria of ensuring confidentiality, availability, and integrity of attorney documents. I further emphasized providing efficiency and usability to encourage future testing of my architecture in law firms. 
                                My experimental results indicate the low computational overhead of adding the secret-sharing approach to a multi-cloud environment, even on consumer grade hardware. This will be essential for integrating law firms as active participants into our architecture. The only possible way of compromising this system is if multiple cloud providers collude, which is still unlikely given that the shares are additionally encrypted.

                                The sheer implications of this security system discorvered by this research from the Univesity of Virginia
                                 and the Georgia Institute of Technology is very appealing.
                                It is scary that a majority of websites are hosted on Content Management Systems (CMS), which 
                                are prone to gradual attacks. I never would have thought that hackers have evolved to stage attacks over a period of weeks. I commend the authors for investigating and implementing an exhaustive number 
                                of algorithms to detect suspicious behavior i.e. (filename entropy, code generation, and extension mismatch).

                                I created my website mainly to document my backpacking trips. As an ultralight backpacker, I spend countless hours scouring through the subreddit and Backpacking Light, researching gear options and cool trails around me. If you take a look at my gear (linked above), it is clear that I take many sacrifices in comfort to streamline my pack weight. For instance, 
                                I do not bring a stove, but rather, I cold soak, allowing cold water to rehydrate my oats, couscous, and other calorie dense foods. Also, I ditched my tent for a flat tarp, so I can utilize my trekking poles and lose a pound. So far, I have section hiked part of the JMT (with my boi Alden and Jeremy) and most of the more minor backpacking trails around me.  
                                As a Boy Scout, I take full advantage of our many outings to test out new gear, like my new tarp! My dream is to hike the PCT after graduation. After becoming intrigued by cybersecurity systems, I began to record some of my projects on my website in my avid exploration of this field. I started by investigating applied cryptography, using current 
                                algorithms for specifc purposes, like my Secret Sharing Architecture for Attorney-Client Data. Recently, I am inreasingly fascinated about forensics and malware detection under the guidance of a eminent researcher in the field. All my projects are recorded on my Github.
